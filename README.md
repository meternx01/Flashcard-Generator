# Flashcard-Generator #
Node.js application to display flashcards for learning

## Objectives ##
1. Demonstrate how to construct objects.
2. Create modules of the constructors.
3. Integrate those modules and construct objects

## Solution ##
We were asked to create two flashcard types, and to display one side or a question, and when commanded, flip the card "over" to display the answer.

- Basic Flashcard
	-
	Flashcard that has a question on the front side, and the answer on the back.

- Cloze Card
	-
	Flashcard that has a statement that has an answer redacted from it, and the redacted word on the back.
